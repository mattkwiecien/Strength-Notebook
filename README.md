# StrengthTracker
Strength Tracker is a lightweight web application meant for easily tracking workout progress over time.  Using Strength Tracker a user can create new workouts and view historical workouts.  Each workout allows a user to enter an exercise type (i.e. deadlift), a weight, a number of sets, and a number of repetitions per set.
